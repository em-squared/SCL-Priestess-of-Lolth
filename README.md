A mod for Sword Coast Legends that adds Priestess of Lolth ability tree for Cleric class.

## Spell list

**Conjure Spider :** Summons a spider from the Demonweb Pits, with bonuses to Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity equal to the caster's Wisdom modifier. The summoned creature will match the caster's level, up to level 6,12,20. The animal will remain by the caster's side until defeated, 120 seconds have passed, or the spell is used again.
 
**Disciple of Lolth (Cantrip) :** Infuses the caster's weapon with poison with each strike. When the caster hits a creature with this attack, it must succeed on a DC 10(+WIS+Proficiency) Constitution saving throw or take poison damage and poison damage over time for 60 seconds.
 
**Animate Dead :** Same as Necromancer Wizard. When a noble house attacks another one, it must remain no evidence. Then priestesses raise back dead bodies to bring themselves to the grave.
 
**Summon Undead :** Same as Necromancer Wizard but with Wisdom modifier to DC. Sometimes, a little help from the dead might be requested. Some powerfull matron mother with the favor of Lolth can achieve the Zin-carla ritual.
 
**Confusion :** Same as Enchanter Wizard but with Wisdom modifier to DC. Priestesses do not fight each other with swords but with mental assaults.
 
**Charm :** Same as Enchanter Wizard but with Wisdom modifier to DC. Renegates are not tolerated. Those who defy a High Priestess of Lolth are forced to obey, by mind control if necessary.
 
**Invisibility :** Same as Control Wizard. No one sees the spider before its web entangle his prey.
 
**Mass Invisibility :** Same as Control Wizard. Strike fast with no witness.
